```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This should be red
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This should be blue
  </div>
</div>
```
This code produces unexpected results because the order of classes in Tailwind CSS matters. If you have conflicting styles, the last one declared will take precedence. In this case, the `bg-blue-500` class is declared last, so both divs will have a blue background instead of the expected red and blue.
